Hello and welcome to my GitHub.
This folder will contain exercises from a Data Stuctures and Algorithm course I am taking as a crash course and refresh.
Some exercises will contain multiple solutions, with notes on how each solution works.
All extra solutions are commented out so that the tests run successfully. Feel free to test out all of the solutions.
All of my tests are ran using jest watch on the test files provided, or node-inspect, but can also be ran in any JS playground.

Big thank you to Stephen Grider from Udemy for providing this awesome crash course. 
I hope that these solutions will help some of you who are looking to learn or brush up on your Data Structure and Algorithms skills. 
Although a lot of these solutions are provided during the course, I have added my own comments to show my thinking 
while I was working out these problems, and even provided some extra solutions just to test myself and find different ways to solving each problem.
